To reach this goal, I investigated the data available to me, and through this data and after analyzing it, I identified the 15 busiest stations in total during a period of 3 months as shown in the graph above.	

And through the graph shown above, we got to know the 15 most crowded stations, as shown in the y axis, the names of the busiest stations.
