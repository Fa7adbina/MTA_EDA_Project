* What is the framing question of your analysis, or the purpose of the model/system you plan to build?  

My plan is to know the busiest station during the weekends, to put a blood donation truck to fill the need for blood in hospitals and to educate the donor about the benefit of donating for blood regeneration


* Who benefits from exploring this question or building this model/system?
Hospitals and blood banks
